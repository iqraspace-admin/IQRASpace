/**
 * Replaces the old static public/manifest.webmanifest. As a static file
 * it hardcoded "/icon", "/apple-icon", and start_url "/" — none of which
 * account for NEXT_BASE_PATH="/quran" in production, so the installed
 * PWA's icons would 404 and it would start outside this app entirely
 * (see PROJECT-STATUS.md's production-readiness notes). A Next.js
 * metadata route is basePath-aware for its own URL (served at
 * /quran/manifest.webmanifest, with the matching <link rel="manifest">
 * auto-emitted by the root layout) but the *values inside* it still need
 * building by hand — hence basePath() here.
