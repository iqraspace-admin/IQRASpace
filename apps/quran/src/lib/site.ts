/**
 * Single source of truth for this app's public site origin and base
 * path — every place that builds an absolute/canonical URL (root
 * layout metadata, manifest, sitemap, per-page canonicals) reads from
 * here instead of hardcoding the domain or "/quran", so the two can
 * never drift apart if either ever changes.
 *
 * ARCHITECTURE.md §8: this app is served at https://iqraspace.org/quran
 * as a Cloudflare Worker route on the iqraspace.org zone (wrangler.jsonc).
 * NEXT_BASE_PATH=/quran is set by `npm run build:cf` (scripts/build-cf.mjs)
 * for production, mirroring next.config.ts's `basePath`. Local dev and CI
 * builds leave it unset, so URLs built here fall back to the bare
 * origin — correct for those environments too, not just production.
