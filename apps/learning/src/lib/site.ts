/**
 * Single source of truth for this app's public site origin and base
 * path — every place that builds an absolute/canonical URL (root layout
 * metadataBase, manifest) reads from here instead of hardcoding the
 * domain or "/learning", so the two can never drift apart if either ever
 * changes. Same shape as apps/quran/src/lib/site.ts, which solved the
 * same problem first.
 *
 * This app is served at https://iqraspace.org/learning via a Multi-Zones
 * Cloudflare Worker route (iqraspace.org/learning*) — see
 * next.config.ts's basePath comment. NEXT_BASE_PATH=/learning is set in
 * `npm run build:cf` (Cloudflare Workers Static Assets); local dev and
 * CI builds leave it unset, so URLs built here fall back to the bare
 * origin — correct for those environments too, not just production.
